# Perceptrons

This project implements perceptrons to model various logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, etc.).

## Structure
- Individual perceptrons for each logic gate
- Stacking of models for more complex operations
- Visualization of decision boundaries

## Setup
```
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the models
```
python src/train.py
```
